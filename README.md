## Frontend - Bad HTML Edition

A retro, unprofessional voting interface with a "bad HTML/CSS" aesthetic from 40 years ago.

### Setup

1. Install dependencies:
```bash
npm install
```

2. Start the development server:
```bash
npm run dev
```

3. Open your browser and navigate to the URL shown in the terminal (usually `http://localhost:5173`)

### Features

- **Voting Page**: Two side-by-side cards for voting, with skip and draw/tie buttons
- **Leaderboard Page**: Placeholder page (to be styled later)
- **Retro Aesthetic**: Clashing colors, pixelated graphics, dotted borders, and all the hallmarks of bad Web 1.0 design

### Note

The pointing finger GIF image should be placed in the `public/` directory as `pointing-finger.gif`. If the GIF is not found, the app will fall back to a pixelated SVG version.
